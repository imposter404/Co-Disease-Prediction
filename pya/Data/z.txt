Key Insights
Metabolic Syndromes (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) are the most prevalent clusters, affecting 30–50% of adults with multimorbidity.

Mental-Physical Comorbidities: Depression co-occurs with 60–70% of chronic physical conditions.

Treatment Burden: Combinations like diabetes + arthritis + cardiovascular disease incur 2–3× higher medical costs than single diseases.

For disease-specific management guidelines, refer to clustered condition research (e.g., cardiometabolic or psychiatric-substance abuse patterns).

Download this data
Download this data
You cannot directly download the raw multimorbidity disease co-occurrence data from the referenced studies or their publisher websites. Most of these resources provide summaries, figures, or supplementary materials within the articles, but individual-level or full pairwise disease co-occurrence datasets are not openly downloadable due to privacy, ethical, and data governance restrictions.

However, some studies-such as the one published in Nature Scientific Data-do provide open access to disease embeddings and cluster assignments as supplementary materials or through linked repositories. For example, the study by Momen et al. (2024) offers access to disease embeddings and cluster assignments for researchers, but you must follow the instructions in the article’s supplementary materials or data availability statement to access them. These files are typically provided in formats such as CSV, Excel, or Word documents and may require institutional or research credentials for access.

Steps you can take:

Visit the article’s main page and look for a “Supplementary Information,” “Data Availability,” or “Download” section.

If available, download the provided files (e.g., disease cluster assignments, disease embeddings).

For systematic reviews and meta-analyses, check for supplementary tables or appendices that may list disease pairs or clusters.

Example:
The article on ScienceDirect provides a “Download Word document” link for simulated data and health records used in latent class analysis. This may contain example data or summary statistics, but not the full raw EHR dataset.

If you require full, individual-level or comprehensive co-disease occurrence data:

You will likely need to apply for access through the relevant data governance body, institutional review board, or data access committee as described in the article or dataset documentation.

For meta-analytic cluster data, you may contact the corresponding authors or check for public repositories referenced in the publication.

Summary:

Direct download of raw co-disease occurrence data is not available due to privacy and ethical restrictions.

Cluster assignments and summary data may be available as supplementary files or via request.

Always review the “Data Availability” and “Supplementary Information” sections of the article for download options.

If you need help finding the specific supplementary files or applying for data access, let me know the exact article or dataset you’re interested in.
