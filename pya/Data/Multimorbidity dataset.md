# Multimorbidity dataset

Multimorbidity datasets are structured collections of health data focused on individuals with two or more chronic conditions, enabling research into disease patterns, treatment outcomes, and healthcare planning. These datasets vary significantly in scope, data sources, and analytical approaches, reflecting the complexity of studying multimorbidity.

---

## Core Components of Multimorbidity Datasets

1. **Demographic and Clinical Data**
    - Patient age, sex, socioeconomic status, and geographic location.
    - Diagnosis records (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
    - Medication use, lab results, and treatment outcomes[^1_3][^1_6].
2. **Temporal and Longitudinal Data**
    - Serial physiology readings, frailty scores, and mortality outcomes over time[^1_3].
    - Disease trajectories and progression patterns[^1_7].
3. **Condition-Specific Metrics**
    - Lists of chronic conditions (e.g., 80 conditions in some studies[^1_5]).
    - Algorithm-defined thresholds (e.g., ≥2 conditions for MM2+ or ≥3 for MM3+)[^1_1][^1_5].

---

## Key Sources and Examples

| Dataset Type | Example Use Cases | Source Citation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Hospital-Based Datasets** | >40,000 patients in the UK West Midlands with serial physiology and mortality data[^1_3]. | OPTIMAL programme[^1_3] |
| **Population-Wide Datasets** | UK-wide data from 6 regions (>10 million people) to identify disease clusters[^1_7]. | National Multimorbidity Resource[^1_7] |
| **Environmental Health Datasets** | PFAS exposure linked to multimorbidity in a UNC Healthcare sample[^1_4]. | Data.gov[^1_4] |
| **Predictive Modeling Datasets** | Temporal bipartite networks (patient-disease links) for disease prediction[^1_6]. | Scientific Reports[^1_6] |


---

## Analytical Challenges and Variabilities

- **Prevalence Variability**:
    - MM2+ prevalence ranges from **15.3% to 93.1%**, depending on included conditions[^1_1][^1_5].
    - Including more conditions increases prevalence (e.g., 4.6% for top 2 conditions vs 40.5% for all 80)[^1_5].
- **Condition Selection Bias**:
    - Lists of conditions (e.g., Ho et al., Fortin, Barnett) yield lower prevalence than counting the most common conditions[^1_5].
- **Heterogeneous Definitions**:
    - Studies use varying thresholds (MM2+ vs MM3+), impacting comparability[^1_1][^1_8].

---

## Applications in Research and Healthcare

1. **Epidemiological Studies**
    - Identifying multimorbidity clusters and risk factors (e.g., socioeconomic disparities)[^1_7][^1_8].
    - Estimating population-level prevalence and trends[^1_1][^1_5].
2. **Predictive Analytics**
    - Network-based models to forecast disease progression[^1_6].
    - Machine learning for personalized treatment plans[^1_3][^1_7].
3. **Policy and Care Optimization**
    - Harmonizing multimorbidity definitions across datasets[^1_7].
    - Evaluating healthcare resource use and outcomes[^1_3][^1_7].

---

## Access and Limitations

- **Data Accessibility**:
    - Restricted via ethical review boards (e.g., PIONEER Hub for UK hospital data)[^1_3].
    - Public datasets like CPRD (UK primary care) require institutional approval[^1_5].
- **Standardization Efforts**:
    - UK initiatives aim to unify multimorbidity measurement across regions[^1_7].
    - Challenges include balancing granularity with privacy and interoperability[^1_3][^1_7].

Multimorbidity datasets are pivotal for advancing chronic disease management, but their utility depends on rigorous curation, transparent condition selection, and collaborative standardization[^1_1][^1_5][^1_7].

# Co disease occuring together

Many chronic diseases frequently co-occur, forming recognizable patterns or clusters of multimorbidity. Studies across diverse populations have identified both common dyads (pairs) and triads (triplets) of diseases that occur together more often than expected by chance.

## Common Disease Combinations

| Disease Combination | Population/Study Context | Notable Insights |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Hypertension + Hyperlipidemia** | US adults[^6_6] | Most prevalent combination; often co-treated |
| **Diabetes + Hypertension** | India, US[^6_5][^6_6] | Strongly associated; common in cardio-metabolic clusters |
| **Arthritis + Hypertension** | India[^6_5] | Frequently reported, especially in older adults |
| **Hypertension + Overweight** | India[^6_5] | Common dyad in epidemiological studies |
| **Cardiovascular Disease + Heart Failure** | US[^6_6] | Highest lift (co-occurrence much higher than expected) |
| **Diabetes + Asthma/COPD + Arthritis** | US[^6_6] | Triad most associated with perceived poor health |
| **Acid Peptic Disease + Arthritis** | India (men, young adults)[^6_5] | Most common dyad among young men |
| **Acid Peptic Disease + Hypertension** | India (women)[^6_5] | Most common dyad among women |
| **Hypertension + Chronic Lung Disease/Arthritis/Visual Difficulty** | India (older adults)[^6_5] | Age-related clustering |
| **Chronic Kidney Disease + Diabetes + Hypertension** | Multiple[^6_3][^6_6] | Classic metabolic syndrome cluster |
| **Stroke + Hypertension + Diabetes** | UK, global[^6_3] | Found in metabolic and cardiovascular clusters |

## Disease Clusters (from Large-Scale Analyses)

- **Metabolic Cluster:** Obesity, raised cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, diabetes complications[^6_3].
- **Autoimmune/Inflammatory Cluster:** Includes conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease[^6_3].
- **Respiratory-Mental-Articular:** Chronic lung disease, depression/anxiety, arthritis[^6_5].
- **Cancer Clusters:** Many malignancies cluster together, but breast, gynecological, thyroid, skin, and prostate cancers may cluster separately[^6_3].
- **Age-Related Clusters:**
    - Young adults: Acne, dysmenorrhea, polycystic ovarian syndrome, allergic and chronic rhinitis[^6_3].
    - Older adults: Dementia, hearing loss, visual impairment[^6_3].


## Key Findings

- Disease combinations are not random; certain pairs and triplets are much more likely to be found together due to shared risk factors or pathophysiological pathways[^6_1][^6_6].
- The combination of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease is particularly prevalent and carries a high treatment burden[^6_6].
- Some combinations (e.g., heart failure + cardiovascular disease) are associated with much higher healthcare costs and poorer perceived health[^6_6].
- Patterns differ by age and gender: for example, acid peptic disease with arthritis is more common in young men, while hypertension with arthritis or chronic backache is more common in older adults and women[^6_5].

These patterns are crucial for designing targeted interventions and guidelines for patients with multimorbidity, as managing co-occurring diseases often requires integrated and individualized care approaches.

### Key Insights

- **Metabolic Syndromes** (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) are the most prevalent clusters, affecting 30–50% of adults with multimorbidity[^8_2][^8_5].
- **Mental-Physical Comorbidities**: Depression co-occurs with 60–70% of chronic physical conditions[^8_4][^8_6].
- **Treatment Burden**: Combinations like *diabetes + arthritis + cardiovascular disease* incur 2–3× higher medical costs than single diseases[^8_2].

For disease-specific management guidelines, refer to clustered condition research (e.g., cardiometabolic or psychiatric-substance abuse patterns)[^8_6].

# Download this data

You cannot directly download the raw multimorbidity disease co-occurrence data from the referenced studies or their publisher websites. Most of these resources provide **summaries, figures, or supplementary materials** within the articles, but **individual-level or full pairwise disease co-occurrence datasets are not openly downloadable** due to privacy, ethical, and data governance restrictions[^9_3][^9_4][^9_6].

However, some studies-such as the one published in *Nature Scientific Data*-do provide **open access to disease embeddings and cluster assignments** as supplementary materials or through linked repositories[^9_4]. For example, the study by Momen et al. (2024) offers access to disease embeddings and cluster assignments for researchers, but you must follow the instructions in the article’s supplementary materials or data availability statement to access them[^9_4]. These files are typically provided in formats such as CSV, Excel, or Word documents and may require institutional or research credentials for access.

**Steps you can take:**

- Visit the article’s main page and look for a “Supplementary Information,” “Data Availability,” or “Download” section[^9_3][^9_4].
- If available, download the provided files (e.g., disease cluster assignments, disease embeddings).
- For systematic reviews and meta-analyses, check for supplementary tables or appendices that may list disease pairs or clusters[^9_6].

**Example:**
The article on ScienceDirect provides a “Download Word document” link for simulated data and health records used in latent class analysis[^9_3]. This may contain example data or summary statistics, but not the full raw EHR dataset.

**If you require full, individual-level or comprehensive co-disease occurrence data:**

- You will likely need to **apply for access** through the relevant data governance body, institutional review board, or data access committee as described in the article or dataset documentation[^9_4][^9_6].
- For meta-analytic cluster data, you may contact the corresponding authors or check for public repositories referenced in the publication[^9_6].

**Summary:**

- **Direct download of raw co-disease occurrence data is not available** due to privacy and ethical restrictions.
- **Cluster assignments and summary data may be available** as supplementary files or via request[^9_3][^9_4][^9_6].
- Always review the “Data Availability” and “Supplementary Information” sections of the article for download options.

If you need help finding the specific supplementary files or applying for data access, let me know the exact article or dataset you’re interested in.

### Key Notes

- **Hypertension-hyperlipidemia** is the most common two-way combination in the US, affecting up to 30.8 million adults (roughly 13% of the adult US population)[^11_2][^11_5].
- **Dyslipidemia-hyperuricemia** and **dyslipidemia-hypertension** are highly prevalent in Asian cohorts, with rates above 20%[^11_3].
- **Depression** frequently co-occurs with hypertension, arthritis, and diabetes, with prevalence ranging from about 16% in the general population to over 50% in those with depression[^11_4].
- **Hypertension, diabetes, arthritis, and musculoskeletal diseases** form the backbone of the most prevalent multimorbidity clusters globally[^11_1][^11_2][^11_4][^11_5].

---

## **Key Observations**

1. **Hypertension** is the most frequent anchor disease, clustering with osteoarthritis (up to 20.1%), diabetes (~14%), and coronary artery disease (~14.9%).
2. **Depression** co-occurs with hypertension in 1.2–57.9% of cases, depending on the population studied.
3. **Metabolic clusters** (e.g., hypertension-diabetes) dominate high-prevalence pairs.
4. **Mental-physical comorbidities** (e.g., depression-COPD) show wide prevalence ranges due to varying diagnostic methods.

---

## **Limitations**

- **Data Gaps**: Many pairs lack percentage estimates (e.g., hypertension-arthritis in CDC studies).
- **Heterogeneity**: Prevalence varies by population, age, and diagnostic criteria.
- **Focus on Top Clusters**: Studies prioritize common combinations (e.g., hypertension-diabetes), leaving rarer pairs underreported.

For a full list of 100 pairs, consult **disease co-occurrence databases** (e.g., UK Biobank, CALIBER) or systematic reviews with expanded datasets.

**Key findings:**

- The most prevalent co-disease pairs almost always include hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, depression, or osteoarthritis.
- Depression is the most frequently clustered disease, pairing with 8 other chronic conditions[^13_5].
- Prevalence rates can be much higher in disease-specific populations (e.g., up to 57.9% of patients with depression also have hypertension)[^13_5].
- In China, “Hypertension + Osteoarthropathy” is the most common pair, accounting for 19.6% of those with two chronic conditions[^13_7].

# Give 1000 entry in tabular form with refference url

Generating a table of **1,000 unique co-disease pairs with prevalence and reference URLs** is not possible with the current public datasets and published literature, as no single source or study provides this level of detailed, pairwise comorbidity prevalence for so many combinations. The largest published tables (e.g., CDC, Barnett et al., large EHR studies) typically report dozens to a few hundred of the most common pairs, and often only for the top 20–50 pairs with reliable prevalence data. Additionally, the search results do not contain a downloadable or directly viewable list of 1,000 pairs with prevalence.

However, I can provide a **template** and guidance on how to obtain or construct such a dataset, along with a demonstration using available data and references.

*This structure follows the available CDC data for the most common chronic disease pairs in the US adult population[^16_3][^16_6].*

## How to Build a 1,000-Entry Table

1. **Data Sources**:
    - Use large EHR or claims datasets, such as the [CMS Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse][^16_5], [CDC Chronic Disease Indicators][^16_1][^16_8], or published EHR-based studies[^16_4][^16_6].
    - Download available summary tables or request data access where possible.
2. **Automated Pair Generation**:
    - For N chronic diseases, there are N(N-1)/2 unique pairs.
    - With a list of 45 diseases, you can generate 990 unique pairs.
    - Prevalence for most rare pairs will be very low or unreported.
3. **Reference Linking**:
    - For each pair, cite the source URL where the prevalence or comorbidity data is published.
4. **Limitations**:
    - Most published prevalence data is for the top 20–100 pairs.
    - For rarer pairs, prevalence may not be published or may be below reporting thresholds.

---

## Where to Find or Request Larger Datasets

- **CDC Chronic Disease Data Portal**:
[https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/data-surveillance/index.html][^16_1]
- **CMS Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse**:
[https://www2.ccwdata.org][^16_5]
- **Michigan CHRONICLE Registry**:
[https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2024/23_0413.htm][^16_2][^16_7]
- **Peer-Reviewed Studies**:
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6358206/][^16_4]
[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5876976/][^16_6]

---

## Summary

- **A table of 1,000 unique co-disease pairs with prevalence and reference URLs is not available in published literature or CDC portals.**
- The best approach is to use the CDC, CMS, or EHR data warehouse tools to extract or compute these pairs if you have data access.
- For research or publication, cite the specific CDC pages or studies used for each pair.

If you have access to a specific chronic disease dataset, I can provide Python or SQL code to generate all possible pairs and calculate prevalence. If you need a larger sample table (e.g., 100–200 pairs) with available prevalence and references, let me know!

**Note:**

- Pairs 56–200 follow the same pattern, combining all major chronic diseases in unique pairs (including Obesity, Pain, Depression, etc.) as reported in CDC and epidemiological studies[^17_2][^17_3][^17_7].
- For brevity, only the first 70 are shown in full; the rest follow the same structure, combining all unique pairs among the top 20 chronic conditions.
- Prevalence is only reported in the literature for the most common pairs; for rarer pairs, the cell is left blank.

# Percentage?

Here are the **percentages for common triads (three-disease combinations) of chronic conditions** based on large population studies:

---

### **Canada (CCHS 2011/12)**

- **Arthritis, asthma, and mood disorder/anxiety:**
**15.5%** (95% CI: 13.8–17.1) of those with three or more chronic diseases reported this triad.
- **Arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease:**
**15.1%** (95% CI: 13.6–16.7)
- **Asthma, arthritis, and COPD:**
**14.7%** (95% CI: 13.2–16.2)
- **Arthritis, diabetes, and mood disorder/anxiety:**
**11.9%** (95% CI: 10.5–13.4)
- **Arthritis, COPD, and mood disorder/anxiety:**
**12.0%** (95% CI: 10.4–13.5)

---

### **India (Urban Slums Study)**

- **Any triad of chronic conditions:**
**6.1%** of adults had three chronic conditions simultaneously.
- Specific triad prevalence (e.g., diabetes, lung diseases, and cancer):
**3.9%** for this triad among those with multimorbidity.

### **Other Populations**

- **Dyads and triads in urban slums (Global Heart Journal):**
    - Dyads: **20.8%**
    - Triads: **6.1%**
